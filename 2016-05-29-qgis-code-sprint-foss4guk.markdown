The Open Source community in the UK will get together for another great FOSS4G meeting from 14 to 16 of June in Southampton. 

QGIS has already established itself as one of the major Open Source GIS applications. To help the community to contribute back to the project, we are running a code sprint.   

<!-- more -->

The code sprint session will not require prior knowledge of coding, so all participants are welcome to join. 

There will be several power users and plugin developers to help with the code sprint. There will be 3 topics covered during the code sprint:


- Documentation
- Helping with the bug fixing
- Contributing to web2gis plugin

## Documentation ##

If you are interested in helping with the QGIS documentation, we will run a short presentation to introduce you to the work-flow.

Participants are required to have installed and configured the following software packages:

- Latest QGIS master
- Gitub account
- Git software
- A text editor (Notepad++) software
- An image manipulation software (Gimp)


 
## Helping with the bug fixing  ##

For those who are interested in findings bugs, testing existing bugs and cleaning up the bug queue, you will need:

- [An OSGeo ID](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Special:RequestAccount "OSGeo account")
- Multiple versions of QGIS
	- QGIS LTR (LTS)
	- QGIS release
	- QGIS master

If you are familiar with coding (in C++ and python) and would like to fix some bugs, you will need:

- QGIS development environment
- Github account
