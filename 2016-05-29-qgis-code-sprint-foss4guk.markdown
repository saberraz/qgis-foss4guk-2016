The Open Source community in the UK will get together for another great
[FOSS4G meeting from 14 to 16 of June in Southampton](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2016/). 

[QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/) has already established itself as one of the
major Open Source GIS applications. To help the community to contribute back to
the project, we are running a code sprint.   

<!-- more -->

The code sprint session will not require prior knowledge of coding, so all
participants are welcome to join. Make sure you bring your laptop!

There will be several power users and plugin developers to help with the code
sprint. There will be 3 topics covered during the code sprint:


- Documentation
- Helping with the bug fixing
- Contributing to [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) plugin

## Documentation ##

If you are interested in helping with the QGIS documentation, we will run a
short presentation to introduce you to the workflow.

Participants are required to have installed and configured the following
software packages:

- [Latest QGIS master](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
- [Gitub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home "github")
- [Git software](https://desktop.github.com/ "desktop application")
- A text editor software ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.2.html))
- An image manipulation software ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/))


 
## Helping with the bug fixing  ##

For those who are interested in findings bugs, testing existing bugs and 
leaning up the bug queue, you will need:

- [An OSGeo ID](https://www2.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_create_user.py "OSGeo account")
   - Currently requires contacting OSGeo admins on IRC (#osgeo) in order to get
   the registration form (!)
- [Multiple versions of QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html "qgis osgeo4w installer")
	- QGIS LTR (LTS)
	- QGIS release
	- QGIS master

If you are familiar with coding (in C++ and python) and would like to fix some
bugs, you will need:

- QGIS development environment
- Github account
